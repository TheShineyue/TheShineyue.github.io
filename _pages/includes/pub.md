**Hierarchical Safety Realignment: Lightweight Restoration of Safety in Pruned Large Vision-Language Models** \\ **Yue Li**<sup>\*</sup>, Xin Yi<sup>\*</sup>, Dongsheng Shi, Gerard de Melo, Xiaoling Wang and Linlin Wang<sup>†</sup>.

 [**Arxiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16104) | [**Project**](https://github.com/TheShineyue/HSR) | [**ACL Anthology**](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.394/)
  - The current pruning methods will lead to a significant degradation of the model's safety at a higher sparsity.
  - The HSR (**H**ierarchical **S**afety **R**ealignment) method we proposed can achieve safety realignment for the pruned model by restoring only a very small number of neurons. HSR is effective for both LLM and LVLM.
