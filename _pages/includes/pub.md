[Hierarchical Safety Realignment: Lightweight Restoration of Safety in Pruned Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16104) \\ **Yue Li**<sup>\*</sup>, Xin Yi<sup>\*</sup>, Dongsheng Shi, Gerard de Melo, Xiaoling Wang, Linlin Wang<sup>†</sup>.

  - The current pruning methods will lead to a significant degradation of the model's safety at a higher sparsity.
  - The HSR (**H**ierarchical **S**afety **R**ealignment) method we proposed can achieve safety realignment for the pruned model by restoring only a very small number of neurons. HSR is effective for both LLM and LVLM.
