I am a master student of School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University. My supervisor is Wang Linlin Young Researcher. Before that, I received my undergraduate degree from Xiangtan University under the supervision of Associate Professor Lin Xuan.

My research focuses on the safety of large language models (including multi-modal large language models), and I am very interested in the internals of secure alignment of large language models. At present, I have written and submitted one article each as the first author, and I hope to be accepted soon!
