I am currently a master's student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Young Researcher Linlin Wang. My primary collaborator, Ph.D. Xin Yi, has provided me with invaluable guidance and support throughout my studies. Prior to this, I earned my BEng degree from Xiangtan University, where I was mentored by Associate Professor Xuan Lin.

My research focuses on the safety of large language models (including multi-modal large language models), and I am very interested in the internals of safety alignment of large language models.
